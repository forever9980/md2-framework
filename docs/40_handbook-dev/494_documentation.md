# Documentation

This documentation was built using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is deployed via Github Pages at [https://wwu-pi.github.io/md2-framework/](https://wwu-pi.github.io/md2-framework/).

## Make changes to the documentation
The documentation is written using Markdown files that are located in the `/docs` folder of the repository.
Those files (from the `master` branch) are automatically converted to static HTML files once changes are pushed to the remote Github repository.
In the list of commits, a green checkmark after the commit signifies a new successful build by the system.

To specify the order of items, the individual file headers (so-called YAML frontmatter) have an `order` attribute.
In addition, it is advisable to prefix the files accordingly in order to quickly find the respective part of the documentation.

## Build documentation locally
To build the documentation on the local machine (e.g., to preview the result of changes). Jekyll must be installed.
Detailed [installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) can be found on their homepage.
In particular, an [instruction](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/) is available for Windows users that considers this system's peculiarities.

The current theme is `jekyll-theme-slate` which is provided by Github.
Small adaptations have been made according as can be found in the `/docs/_layouts` folder, in particular regarding the autogenerated navigation (`/docs/_includes`).

By running `bundle exec jekyll serve` on the command line, a server is started that watches for file changes and rebuilds the site locally.
By default, the pages are served at `http://localhost:4000/`.
