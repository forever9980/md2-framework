# Introduction to Modeler's Handbook

This section serves as a handbook for people who want to use the MD² framework to develop mobile business applications.
It consists of

* [installation instructions](520_installation-modeler.html),
* [a guideline for building single apps](530_single-apps.html), providing information about the
  * DSL and its language constructs,
	* the process of model creation using MD²,
	* the code generation, and
	* the deployment process of the developed app
* [information needed for the development of multiple apps](540_multiple-apps.html)
* [information about more advanced additional features of the language](550_additional_features.html).

In general, the MD² framework provides the modeler with an understanding of how to generate a multitude of apps and a corresponding backend out of a single model source.
Using Eclipse as an IDE, convenient features, like the auto formatting of the model code by pressing `STRG+SHIFT+F`, can be used.

Additional (but likely outdated!) information may be found in the [project seminar handbook](https://github.com/ps-md2/md2-documentation), in particular related to the map.apps platform.
