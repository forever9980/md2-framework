# Developing MDÂ² apps for iOS

This page gathers information relevant when developing the iOS generators that generate iOS apps.

iOS apps generated by MD2 consist of two parts: a static (generic) library (part of the target platform in MDSD terminology) and the dynamically generated parts that implement the functionality described in models.
The library is always copied as-is to the generated Xcode project.

In general, a development workflow similar to the following is advisable for the iOS generators, at least in case of larger changes: Modify a generated app to include the desired modifications, essentially utilizing it as a reference implementation. After you are confident about the modifications, adapt the framework, i.e., the iOS generators and the static library as necessary.
